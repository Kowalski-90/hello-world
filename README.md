Learning how to dev

Hello, world!

I am still a junior on web programming. Well, I am pretty sure that I do not have enough skills to develop anything today. But I'll make some effort to build a strong base knowledge of this particular language, as many others that I want to learn. Stay sharp and feel free to help me understand how to talk to the machines! Bye
